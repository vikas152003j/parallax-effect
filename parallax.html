            <p class="text">
                Adventure sports completely differ from the traditional sports due to the extreme risk factor involved and also the thrill which is experienced in these types of sports. In some countries, these sports are also called “extreme sports.”

                <br><br>
      These games gained the popularity in the 90s when some marketing companies started to promote them. These sports include a huge variety of sports which ranges from wind surfing, aero sports, kite surfing, bungee jumping, skydiving, scuba diving, paragliding, parasailing and many more to extreme sports like for instance rock climbing, cave diving and mountain biking.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Biking (also known as bicycling or Cycling) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. 
                <br><br>
                The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office – and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters. Compared to the ubiquitous motorcar, cycles contribute almost nothing to air or noise pollution, besides giving the rider plenty of opportunity to get in some exercise. In cities, bikes help lessen traffic congestion and assist in solving seemingly perennial parking problems, as well as offering easier manoeuvrability. The bike, then, has plenty of things going for it – it’s kinder to the environment; it costs little to buy, operate and maintain; it is incredibly convenient to own; and it is the ideal way to fitness. All of these factors contribute towards making cycling a fun and enjoyable activity.
There are three types of cycling: Utility, recreational (touring, organized rides, mountain) and racing.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.
                <br><br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
